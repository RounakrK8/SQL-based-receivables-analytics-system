# SQL-based-receivables-analytics-system
SQL-based receivables analytics project that builds a structured invoice source-of-truth layer, DSO metrics, collections effectiveness analysis, and customer risk scoring. Power BI is used on top for dashboard visualization.
Many companies sell on credit, meaning customers receive an invoice and pay later. While this helps grow the business, it also creates real challenges — tracking unpaid invoices, managing overdue accounts, monitoring credit risk, and understanding how effective collections efforts actually are.

In most systems, invoice, payment, and customer data live across multiple tables. Without a structured approach, it’s hard to get a clear and reliable view of outstanding receivables. On top of that, real-world financial data often contains issues like duplicate payments, incorrect allocations, invoices marked as paid but still open, or payments applied to invalid invoices. If these problems aren’t handled properly, financial reporting and decision-making can quickly become inaccurate.

This project builds a structured, SQL-driven receivables analytics system that turns raw transactional data into clear, decision-ready insights. It creates a single source of truth for invoice balances, analyzes overdue behavior, measures collections effectiveness, identifies high-risk customers, and performs data quality checks. The goal is simple: make receivables data easier to understand, more reliable, and more useful for managing cash flow and credit risk.
